								of <span class="ree-text rt40">Consumer Search Opportunities</span></h2>
							<p class="mb20">Pay per click marketing is a paid search model used to build brand awareness, promote brand offerings and gain immediate traction from specific audience segments. With PPC, advertisers only pay each time a user clicks on the PPC ads -- hence the name pay-per-click.

								People usually think of Google PPC when hearing or talking about what is pay per click. But pay-per-click goes beyond the Google search engine results pages (SERPs) and the Google Display Network. Social media sites, such as YouTube, Facebook, Pinterest and LinkedIn, also use the pay per click model.</p>
							<p class="mb20">QuackLabs Internet Marketing Agency is a trusted leader in pay per click internet marketing. Our pay per click advertising company partners with various industry players and marketing professionals to increase their leads, grow brand awareness and reach their goals. </p>
							<p class="mb20">Throughout the years, our pay per click marketing firm has mastered what is PPC, how it works effectively for different stakeholders and what it entails to ensure online success. If you’re still unsure whether pay per click is the right advertising model for your company, our PPC management firm is here to help you.</p>

						<h2>Our Key Expertise</h2>

							<h3 class="mb15">Search Ads </h3>
							<p>Search advertising is the most common form of paid search marketing. Search ads appear to prospects who are already looking for your industry or brand offerings online. These pay per click ads are suitable for short sales cycles or one-time campaign promotions. Our pay per click advertising firm recommends search advertising to businesses aiming to acquire strong, high-quality leads from new customers. <br><br></p>

						<div class="ree-card-content mt40">
							<h3 class="mb15">Display Ads</h3>
							<p>Display advertising is known for its effectiveness in reaching more than 90 percent of online users. Display ads appear on Google’s partner websites, targeting people who visited industry-related sites. Display advertising maximizes photos and texts to capture the online users’ attention and convince them to take action. Our pay per click advertising agency recommends display advertising to companies with lengthy sales cycles and niche or luxury customers. <br></p>

							<h3 class="mb15">Social Ads </h3>
							<p>Social media paid advertising is the fastest-growing segment of pay per click advertising services. Social ads appear on social media platforms, such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. They are programmed to reach prospects based on their hobbies, networks and interests, among other factors. Social media advertising is suitable for brands with an active social media presence and highly-targeted customers. <br> <br> </p>

						<div class="ree-card-content mt40">
							<h3 class="mb15">Remarketing Ads</h3>
							<p>Remarketing is one of the best ways to reach high-converting customers and double your turnovers. Remarketing ads remind people who have already visited your website to come back and compel them to convert. Unlike search advertising, remarketing is relatively cheaper because there are lower competition and highly targeted customer segments. Our PPC marketing firm uses smart PPC ad formats and extensions to produce significant results with your PPC campaign. <br><br><br></p>

							<h3 class="mb15">Google Shopping Ads</h3>
							<p>Google Shopping ads are suitable for websites with a large volume of products. These PPC ads appear in a carousel above or beside the main Google search results, allowing prospects to view the products and prices on Google SERP before they even click onto anyone’s website. This means every click you are paying for has a higher chance of converting, assuming your target customers have already explored all product offerings on Google Shopping ads. Our PPC agency recommends Google Shopping to eCommerce businesses aiming to reach customers with clear buying intent. </p>

							<h3 class="mb15">In-stream Ads</h3>
							<p class="mb-5">In-stream ads are also called YouTube ads. These are pay-per-click ads that appear on YouTube search results, YouTube videos and video partners on Display Network. YouTube ads present your brand in a unique and memorable way. Recently, Facebook has launched in-stream ads, allowing companies to place advertisements in the best slots and natural breaks in video content. <br><br><br></p>

							<h3 class="mb15">Gmail Sponsored Promotions (GSP)</h3>
							<p class="mb-5">Gmail sponsored promotions are an effective way to generate direct response leads. GSP allows you to reach interested leads right in their inbox. Unlike YouTube ads, GSP has a click-to-call ability that enables prospects to make direct calls to you and convert at any point of your sales funnel. Our PPC company sets up your GSP to maximize its targeting abilities and generate high-quality clicks. <br></p>

							<h3 class="mb15">Local Services Ads</h3>
							<p class="mb-4">Local service ads follow a pay per lead model. This means you don’t have to pay for clicks that don’t turn into leads. Local services advertising is only applicable to a few markets, including HVAC companies, electricians, plumbers and locksmiths. Our PPC firm partners with local service providers to make their businesses more visible to their target demographics. <br><br><br><br></p>

							<p class="mb-5">Amazon advertising is one of the increasingly popular PPC services in the online landscape. Amazon PPC ads allow Amazon sellers to generate brand awareness, boost sales and drive more store visits by placing sponsored ads on the platform's key locations. At Thrive, we leverage our PPC experts’ technical knowledge and expertise to organize your Amazon PPC campaigns and increase your profit margin. <br><br></p>
